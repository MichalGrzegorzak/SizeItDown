# SizeItDown
Goal of this app is to batch convert & resize images and videos to save some space.
It will give you some reports how much space you gained.
I used it to reduce the size of my Google Photos.

Supported extensions:
- photos - ".jpg", ".jpeg", ".png", ".bmp", ".tiff"
- videos - ".mp4", ".avi", ".mpg", ".mpeg", ".wmv", ".webm", ".mov", ".flv", ".mp"

For video compression it depends on:
- Handbrake & HandbrakeCLI

# Handbrake
1. Download and install Handbrake and HandbrakeCLI
2. I created my own preset for H265 (AMD proc that has build in hardware support),
but you can create your own preset and export it
3. HandbrakeCLI.exe needs to be in same folder as this app
